Repo for "Evaluating Models of Robust Word Recognition with Serial Reproduction"

Requires Jupyter with an R kernel; some functions mix R and Python. This requires Python 3.6 for compatibility with rpy 3.3 if using Jupyter 4.6.3

Python dependencies are in requirements.txt; we strongly recommended to install these in a virtual environment and then source the virtual environment as a notebook kernel.

Requires a pysrilm fork compatible with python 3: https://github.com/zhaoyanpeng/pysrilm

For Big LM: use the cached values; TensorFlow has changed considerably in the interim
